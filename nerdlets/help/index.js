                <p>
                  Neon is an application that allows you to create a status
                  visualization at a glance. Neon can be scaled to track the
                  health of entire business units or regions. Statuses are
                  derived from existing New Relic alert policies or from values
                  from New Relic events. Neon makes it easy to configure the
                  visualization to show exactly what you need to see.

                  Alerts and a webhook notification channel set up. Instructions

                    Using the Event dropdown, select the New Relic event that
                    you would like to display in your board. Events that appear
                    in the dropdown are dependent on what you have in your
                    account. For example, if you are using APM, you will see
                    events such as Metric, Transaction, TransactionError, etc

                  <li>
                    Click the + Add button. Your row title is now displayed on

                <p>
                  To monitor the status of the <strong>New Relic event </strong>
                  that you chose when you created a new board such as when an
                  attribute like average(duration) exceeded a certain value
                  repeat steps 1 to 5 from the alert setup.

                  <li>For step 6 select New Relic Attribute</li>
                  <li>
                    In the Attribute Name text field, type in the attribute name
                    like duration. Optionally you can prepend the attribute with
                    an aggregator function such as average(duration).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Click on the COMPARISON dropdown and select less than,
                    equals, or greater than.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In the Value text field, type in the value that you'd like
                    Neon to monitor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For example, Neon can inform you when the average duration
                    of a Page View event exceeds 1 second. Set up Neon using the
                    average(duration) attribute name, with a COMPARISON of
                    greater than, and a value of 1. When this event occurs, Neon
                    will display that actual number that exceeded 1 in red.
